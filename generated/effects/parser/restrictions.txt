Rules:

1.  "if not/found"-constructions binds generated c++ variables vith values.
    Every effect or property should be found before it will be used.
2.  All effects are suitable for mark will be used in expressions.
3.  Don't use "_ANY"-marks (marks with '+') with effects in left part of
    set-instruction.
4.  Field .value of effect is used in expressions implicitly when an effect is
    calculating. Field .time should be
    updated explicitly.
5.  "This" cannot be used with any mark.
6.  Part of effects can be missed when mark "_ANY" is used.
7.  fields of effects not realysed yet.
8.  The compiler response only integer numbers.
9.  Comments can not make output from effects with "_ANY" mark.

10. All functions should clear small buffer after using. Because comments can
    concat each-other. 

11. THIS effect always have pure type because it is calculation for function act().
12. Allowed types of effects: PURE, PERMANENT(_ANY), SHARED(_ANY), PERMASHARED(_ANY), THIS.
13. Set operation is permitted because item($3) will be lost due to expr($5) will be
    calculated. Use second body as WA.

Possible improvements:
1.  Implement mark "_ALL"
2.  Avoid additional checks of effects (marks "_ANY" allow do not have
    one-three).
4.  Optimize writing of text in effect_sup.c: too much duplicated text (it_%s),
    too much finds of line end with strlen().
5.  To fix tabulation (For comments and actions).
6.  Set type of effect to "effect" token-group.
7.  Add string_tree from alchimist project. It allow remove rule (1) and will simplify
    code.

Bug:
1.  Can't correctly close braces (if-levels).
